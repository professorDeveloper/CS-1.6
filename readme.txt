Misc 6.0 Notes:

Assassination Gameplay: One member of the CT team will serve as the VIP.
The object is to get the VIP safely to the pre-defined escape points. If he
dies, the CT's lose the round. If he makes it safely, the CT's win. VIP has
a unique skin, only carries a knife, and has ample body armor. Certain
weapons cannot be purchased by each team in this gameplay scenario.

Escape Gameplay: The T team starts out in a fortified location and must
"escape" to one of the pre-defined escape points. The CT's must exterminate
them before they can escape. The T's win the round once 50% of the team has
successfully escaped. They can also break into the armory to steal weapons,
or just get out of there. The two teams will switch roles after every 8
rounds of play.

After buying NVG, you toggle it on/off by using the "nightvision" command. Be
warned that the NVG will not be effective on every hardware setup. It may or not
work well for you.

To switch between right and left hand weapons, go to:
multiplayer > Customize > Advanced Options
There will be a checkbox for you to select the hand of your choice.

-------------------------------------------------------------



Counter-Strike is a modification (MOD) to the excellent game, Half-Life. 
It modifies the multiplayer aspects of Half-Life to bring to it a more team-oriented 
gameplay. Not terribly unlike Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike provides the player 
with an experience that a trained counter-terrorist unit or terrorist unit experiences.
 
The MOD is team-based featuring one team playing the role of the terrorist and the other 
team playing the role of the counter-terrorist. Each side has access to different guns and 
equipment, as well as different abilities. Maps have have different goals such as: hostage rescue, 
assassination, bomb defusion, Terrorist escape, etc. 

Weapons include the usual assortment of pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, grenades, 
demolition devices. Each side has access to a different subset of weapons so for example only the 
counter-terrorist can use the M4A1, and only the terrorists can use the AK-47.

We are confident that we've created a MOD quite unlike any other. We hope you will be immersed in
the frightening and intense world of Counter-Terrorism.
